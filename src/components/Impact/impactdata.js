      "Despite policy and legal initiatives centered on environmental protection, little has been achieved on the ground to reduce the consequences of environmental degradation for the country and the toll that it continues to take on the people. Over 85% of rural households are affected by worsening crop land conditions, exacerbating the situation beyond an environmental issue, but also a food security one. In particular, the areas that we work are drought-prone and the conservation and efficient use of water becomes critical.",
